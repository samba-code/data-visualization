## Alternative plan

Get first 12 basic charts to level 5.
Then work on more advanced charts.
Means I would get to launch quicker.
I might miss out on doing more advanced charts which would sell my work more effectively.
I won't have too long a break from D3 course.
I can use things I learn from course for more advanced charts.
